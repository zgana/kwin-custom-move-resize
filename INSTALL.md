# Installation Instructions
## Before You Install
If you are in a standard QWERTY environment, take a look at
[main.js](contents/code/main.js).  Take the advice in the comments under
`// Move Shortcuts`, which will make the default keybindings make much more
sense.

## Console Installation
`$ plasmapkg2 -i /path/to/kwin-custom-move-resize`

# Uninstallation Instructions
`$ plasmapkg2 -t KWin/Script -r custommoveresize`

###### Note: The dollar sign (`$`) indicates a shell prompt.
